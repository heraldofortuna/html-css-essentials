## Overview

### The challenge

- Make a separate HTML guide in 3 large parts: Typography, Elements and Blocks.

- The 3 parts will be on different pages and you can access each one from a sidebar.

- Also, each section should have a small sample of HTML code.

* It has no responsive design (for now)

  <span class="code_line--tag">&lt;button</span>
  <span class="code_line--attribute">class=</span
  ><span class="code_line--value">&quot;button button--success&quot;</span
  ><span class="code_line--tag">&gt;</span>Apply now<span class="code_line--tag"
    >&lt;&sol;button&gt;</span
  >
</code>
```
